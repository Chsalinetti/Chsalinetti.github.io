### About Me

I am a student at RIT, majoring in Software Engineering. I am from Dalton, Massachusetts, and went to
high school at Wahconah Regional High School. My intrests include classic rock (my favorite bands being Led Zeppelin, Dire Straits, Journey, and Red Hot Chili Peppers), politics, and playing games such as GTA Online. I am also a big fan of the outdoors. During high school I helped start our video club, which allowed me to gain a lot of experience with tv equipment and using cameras.
